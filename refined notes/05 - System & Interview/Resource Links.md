- **Core Concept:** Knowledge is useless without application. Use this active learning loop to build real mastery.
    
- **The 3-Step Mastery Loop:**
    
    1. **Understand (The Vault):** Pick one small topic from these notes (e.g., Flexbox). Spend 10-15 minutes reviewing only that note.
        
    2. **Apply (The Kata):** Immediately open a blank code file and build something incredibly simple that uses _only that concept_. For Flexbox, build a navbar. For Forms, build a login form. This builds muscle memory.
        
    3. **Teach (The Feynman Technique):** Turn away from your screen and explain the concept out loud to an imaginary beginner. If you get stuck, you haven't understood it deeply enough. Go back to Step 1.
        
- **Do this for one small concept every day. This is how you build a rock-solid foundation.**
