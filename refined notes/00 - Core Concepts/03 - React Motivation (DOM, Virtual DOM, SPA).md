# 03 - React Motivation
## ⚡ The Problem Before React
- Traditional websites reload the **entire page** for small changes.
- Example:
    - Navbar (N1), Sidebar (SB1), Main (M1), Footer (F1).
    - Clicking "About" → ideally only main content should update.
    - Instead: whole page **blinks twice** (full reload).
- **Costly operations:**
    - Performance issues (extra DOM work).
    - Financial cost (e.g., API image costing $5 per reload).
- Known as **Reconciliation Problem** → too many unnecessary updates.  
---
## 🌳 Virtual DOM Solution
- **Virtual DOM (VDOM):** lightweight JS object copy of real DOM.
- **Diffing Algorithm:** compares new VDOM with old VDOM → finds minimal changes.
- **Efficient Updates:** only required nodes are updated in real DOM.
> [!example] Example  
> Update `<p id="name">Harsh</p>` → only that node is patched, not whole page.

## 📌 Ghost Notification Problem (Facebook Case)
- Facebook faced **state mismatch issues**: ghost messages, duplicate notifications.
- Problem: multiple UI components had **inconsistent states**.
- React introduced **predictable state updates**:  
    - **Hooks** (e.g., `useState`) → component-level state.        
    - Centralized updates → consistent UI.
---
## 📄 SPA (Single Page Application)
- **SPA:** loads a single HTML shell → content swapped dynamically → no full reloads.    
- **JSX:** HTML-like syntax inside JS (not browser-readable).    
- **Babel:** transpiles JSX → plain JS.    
- **Bundler (Webpack, Vite, Parcel):** bundles code → component-based dev, easier debugging.

## 📖 React History
- Developed by **Facebook (Meta)** for UI consistency.
- Open-sourced in **2013**. 
- Marketed as a **library**, but widely used as a **framework**. 
---
## 📝 Notes
- React made updates **predictable** and **cost-efficient**. 
- Virtual DOM ≠ real DOM; it’s an in-memory representation.
- SPA improves UX but relies heavily on JS.

## ⚠️ Traps & Gotchas
> [!warning] Misconception: “React prevents all re-rendering.” → False. React **minimizes** re-rendering using diffing, but inefficient state management can still cause wasted renders.  
> [!warning] JSX is **not HTML**; it must be transpiled by Babel.
